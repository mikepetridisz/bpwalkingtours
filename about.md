## Syllabus

    Data Engineering 2: Big Data and Cloud Computing

**Prerequisites:** 

> R programming 
>
> SQL Knowledge
>
> Linux command-line knowledge 

**Course description**
This is a technology-focused course on cloud and distributed data analytics systems. Current Data Analytics Architectures often work with an amount of data that cannot be fit on a single computer. Even companies that work with reasonably small datasets are expecting rapid growth, so they prefer to use data analytics solutions that are easy to distribute and scale when needed. In this course you will get an overview and hands-on experience with modern distributed data-analytics (a.k.a. Big Data) systems and Serverless Solutions in the cloud. You will see how cloud computing can help you quickly iterate and scale your data analytics infrastructure and how it can help you reduce operational costs. 

**Learning outcomes** 
At the end of this course you will have an overview of Cloud and Big Data technologies applied in modern businesses. You will have a general understanding on how these technologies work and you will be able to reason about when to use or not to use them. You will be hands-on with Amazon Web Services and Apache Spark. Once you completed the assignments for this course, you will be hands-on with the following technologies: - Public Key Encryption - Basic Cloud Computing concepts: Storage, Virtual Machines - Serverless Services for image and text recognition - Spark Architecture and internal operations - Spark SQL and DataFrames in Spark 2 

**Reading List** - Matei Zaharia et al.: Spark, the Definitive Guide (sections)
